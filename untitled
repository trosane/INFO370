                <h3>The I-Factor</h3>
                <p>
                Each city and user is assigned an I-Score. Similar I-Scores suggest that a user resides in the time zone of that city. To come up with the I-Score, we take reddit time-stamps and each hour frequency in its respective slot. If someone posted 5 times at the second UTC hour two then we know the person posted fives times at 2 UTC time.  
                Next, we calculate the percentage of posts per hour for a day for the data set. Since, people tend to act in patterns or divide their time into allocated slots, in order to account for a single hour getting too much or too little weight we divide the day into 12 2-hour slots. Starting at UTC time 0 so 0 and 1 are together and so on and so forth. Then we add the percentage of the two hour slots that are adjacent to each other together so, slot 1 will combined hour 0 and 1 percent of 5 and 6 percent respectively meaning slot 1 will have a score of 11. After each of the 12 scores are calculated. We multiple the score by its respective slot and divide by 2 to ensure the numbers don’t go to out of control so slow  so slot 1 with a percent score of 11 will produce a score of 11 because 11 times 1 equals 11. If slot 12 had a score of 12 we’d multiple 12 by 12 (slot number) divide by 2 to get a score of 77. After this we sum the scores of every slot to the I-Score. We do this because over time and do the distribution of each time zone relative to the UCT timeline being sufficiently different gives us a basis to give a drastically different score for each time zones, as time zones get closer together their scores get closer and closer together.
